Week 7 day 5 Module 7 Project - Big O complexity

In this assessment, I explored the concepts of runtime analysis and algorithm complexity in JavaScript. I began by analyzing and experimenting with different array manipulation functions, such as using .push() and .unshift(), to understand how they scale with varying input sizes. Through practical experimentation and comparison of timing results for different array sizes, I recognized patterns in how the functions performed as the input increased. I also implemented a set of functions to solve classic programming problems, including checking for zero sums, unique characters, pangram sentences, and finding the longest word in a list. Alongside the coding challenges, I documented my observations on space complexity for each solution. This assessment provided me with a hands-on experience in assessing algorithm efficiency, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, and enhancing my proficiency in JavaScript programming.
